// 42. Maximum Difference between Two Elements

// Given an array of integers, find the maximum difference between any two elements such that the larger element appears after the smaller element in the array.

// Return the maximum difference found. If no such pair exists (i.e., the array is in non-increasing order), return -1.

// Example 1:
// Input: arr = [2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1]
// Output: 8
// Explanation:
// The maximum difference is between 10 and 2.
// Example 2:
// Input: arr = [7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2]
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// The maximum difference is between 9 and 7.
